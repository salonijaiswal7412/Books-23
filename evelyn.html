            The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was truly one of the most compelling novels I've ever read. The author did an impeccable job at showing the reader all aspects of Evelyn Hugo and taking us decade by decade throughout her life whilst making it all connect perfectly.Evelyn is a real mystery, and even after 400 pages simply dedicated to her, you're left with so many questions.There is nothing with such perfect drama, and LGBTQ+ representation in any other book as displayed in this. To put it simply, you must read this book, as it will change your perspective on life.

       <H2>MY REVIEW</H2>
       <p id="details">I really loved this book and Evelyn Hugo,Even though I known this is a fiction yet I felt so connected to all the characters in the book.I just love how it is shown that even a superstar like Evelyn wasn't as happy as she showed and I believe that shows how vulnerable we humans are no matter our status.I know Evelyn did a lot of bad things in her life and also created so many scandals yet she was "EVELYN HUGO" and ig that is all that matters.LGBTQ representation is also beautifully represented in the book.Really a must read for everyone.Full of drama,you wont get bored!! </p>
